# Getting started

Documentation for version: **v0.1.0**

## Overview

`offchain` is an open-source Python package for processing both **onchain and offchain** NFT metadata. The purpose of this project is to enable anyone to define and standardize their own custom NFT metadata schema.

`offchain` powers the Zora Indexer, and any contributions to metadata parsing implementations will be reflected in the Zora API. If you'd like to contribute your own metadata parsing implementation, please see the `Contributing` page.
